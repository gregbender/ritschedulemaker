Legacy Project (2001) - Classes at RIT are scheduled through an online web-based interface called SIS. The SIS system is fairly robust, but is missing a critical feature - graphical schedules. You can get a confusing text printout of your schedule, but a graphical schedule would be more useful.The RIT Schedule Maker takes care of this problem. Simply type in your course numbers, and the RIT Schedule Maker will create a graphical HTML schedule for online use or printout.
